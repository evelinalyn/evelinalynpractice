		<h1>The French Royal Family</h1>
		<p> The royal family of France is one of the two that have since been abolished on this website. though the french royal family is no longer, the palaces are still standing strong. Although there are many other sights to see in France, I strongly diggest you make time in your trip to visit the royal spots. </p>

		 <p>Perhaps one of the most famous palaces in Europe, Versailles is an incredible palace worthy of spending a day visiting. It was perhaps one of my favorite stops when I visited France a few years ago. It's rooms and courtyards are as stunnning and beautiful as its imoressive gardens. its well worth your time, and just 30 minutes from Paris, so what are you waiting for?</p>
