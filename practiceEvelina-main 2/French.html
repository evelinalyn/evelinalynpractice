		 <p>perhaps one of the most famous Palaces in europe, Versailles is an incredible palace worthy of spending a day visiting. It was perhaps one of my favorite stops when I visited France a feww years ago. It's rooms and courtyards are as stunnning and beautiful as its imoressive gardens. its well worth your time, so what are you waiting for?</p>
