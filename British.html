		<h1>The British Royal Family</h1>

		<p>This royal family is probably the most famous royal family of Europe, or even the world. They have so many palaces and castles of signifigance. It was hard for me to only choose one, but I think the one I chose was the grandest and most castle like. Although I am only showing you one of the Castles, I really suggest you visit other british estates! </p>

			<p>Windsor castle is one of the more known castles from the 
			British Royal Family. It is located just 45 minutes from london, a perfect way to spend an afternoon in England. While this is the one castle on the list I haven't been to, I am positive it is a great destination to visit, so what are you waiting for? </p>
